# Task 1: Capitalizing Words in a String

**Description:**
I wrote a Python program that accepts a string as input and capitalizes the first letter of each word in the string. The program then returns the updated string.

**Main Functionalities:**
1. **Takes input string**: The program takes an input string from the user.
2. **Splits the string into a list of words**: The sting is split into words
3. **Capitalizes words**: Each word in the string has its first letter capitalized.
3. **Returns the result**: After processing the string, the program returns the string with capitalized words.

# Task 2: FAQ Accordion using HTML, CSS, and JS

**Description:**
I created a basic FAQ accordion where the answers are displayed when a question is clicked. The accordion hides the previous answer when a new question is clicked, and the icons change to reflect the answer's visibility (plus to minus).

**Main Functionalities:**
1. **Displays answer on click**: When a question is clicked, its corresponding answer is displayed.
2. **Hides previous answer**: When a new question is clicked, the previously shown answer is hidden.
3. **Icons change**: The icon changes to indicate whether the answer is visible or not (from plus to minus).
4. **Responsiveness**: A media query is used to ensure the accordion is responsive on different screen sizes.
